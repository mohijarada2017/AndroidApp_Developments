Python 3.7.4 Offline Docs - Android version

Objective of this Android app, is to give to any Python developers ability to have an offline version of Python 3.7.4 HTML documentation on Mobile or Tablet, which can be browsable and searchable offline, without any Internet need.

Original source of Python documentation which I used here is coming from https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html and not altering any original content, just publishing and converting the online HTML version to a Google Android app, using Google Android Studio version 3.5

Original idea came from these articles, which I am grateful to them:
- https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/webview/gettingstarted
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44337730/activity-with-webview-crashing-android-studio

Content copyright is solely and only belongs to Python community: https://docs.python.org/3/

I hope everyone will get the benefits from this app.
